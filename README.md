# Born2beroot
This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

Theoretical questions
Here are the theoretical questions you will be asked during the evaluation:
1. How does a virtual machine work ? And what its purpose ?
2. Wh did you choose Debian or Rockey ?
3. What's the difference between Debian and Rockey ?
4. If you chose Debian: what's the difference between aptitude, apt and what's APPArmor ?
5. If you chose Rockey: what's SELinux and DNF ?
6. What the advantages/disadvantages of a strong password policy ? What can you say about its implementation ?
7. What's a partition ? And more generally how does LVM (Logical Volume Management) work ?
8. What's sudo ? 
9. What's an UFW and what's the value of using it ?
10. What's SSH (Secure Shell) and what's the value of using it ?
11. What is cron ?
